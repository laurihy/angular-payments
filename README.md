# Angular Payments

An Angular Module that provides directives for *formatting* and *validating* forms related to payments. Also, it ships with a directive that makes it easy to integrate with Stripe's wonderful stripe.js.

### Credits

This library wasn't just heavily inspired by Stripe's jQuery.payments, but is in fact mostly just a port of it to a more AngularJS-oriented style.

Also, stripeForm is pretty much directly from gtramontina's Stripe Angular: https://github.com/gtramontina/stripe-angular

All I did was port and combine these great libraries. Cheers!

## Usage

To use Angular Payments, add angularPayments as a dependency to your AngularJS module or app.

Angular Payments it self depends on 2 libraries:

1. Angular (d'oh)
2. Stripe.js (https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js)

Be sure to also configure Stripe by setting your publishable key, something like:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.stripe.com/v2/"></script>
	<script>
		Stripe.setPublishableKey('YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY');
	</script>

The module ships 3 directives, all of which should be added as attributes to elements. 

### paymentsValidate

Is used for validating fields on the client side. Usage:

	<input type="text" ng-model="blah" payments-validate="VALIDATION_TYPE" />

For validation to work, element must have an associated ng-model -value.

Possible validation types are:


#### card

	<input type="text" ng-model="number" payments-validate="card" />
	
Card validation also uses an extra attribute "payments-type-model". This attribute defines a model on the scope where the card type will be set as the field recognizes the type from the number.

	<input type="text" ng-model="number" payments-validate="card" payments-type-model="type"/>
	
In this case $scope.number will have the card number from the field and $scope.type will have the credit card type.

The card validator will also place a $card object on the on the input control as the card type is recognized.  This card object has a number of different fields.  It's easiest to get to this object if both the form and the input have a name, in which case you can access the card object at $scope.formName.inputName.$card.

#### expiry

	<input type="text" ng-model="expiry" payments-validate="expiry" />

Expiry actually matches, that a string with format mm / yy[yy] is a valid and non-expired date. It's pretty cool when combined with matching formatting. Again, ported from jQuery.payments.

#### cvc

	<input type="text" ng-model="cvc" payments-validate="cvc" />
	
CVC validation also uses an extra attribute "payments-type-model". This attribute defines a model on the scope where the CVC will load the card type in order to validate CVC rules based on the card.  This attribute is meant to be used in conjunction with the same attribute on the card validation.

	<input type="text" ng-model="cvc" payments-validate="cvc" payments-type-model="type"/>
	
In this case the CVC field will change its validation rules when $scope.type changes.  For example, a 'visa' type will require 3 digits, but an 'amex' type will allow 3 or 4.

### paymentsFormat

Is used for formatting fields.

	<input type="text" payments-format="FORMATTING_TYPE" />
	
For formatting to work, element must have an associated ng-model -value.

Possible formats:

#### card

	<input type="text" payments-format="card" />

- After every 4th character a space (" ") character is added
- Maximum 16 characters (excluding those spaces)
- Only digits

#### Expiry

	<input type="text" payments-format="expiry" />

- Essentially "mm / yyyy"
- After two digits for months, insert slash ("/")
- Accept only digits and at most 6 of them (excluding the slash)

#### cvc

	<input type="text" payments-format="cvc" />

- Limit to 4 digits
- *Could also be used to match with card type, but this is not implemented yet.*

### stripeForm

Intercepts form-submission, obtains stripeToken and then fires a callback. Essentially abstracts away what you would do manually when following instructions at https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js

	<form stripe-form="CALLBACK"> 
	...
	</form>

Instead of sending the form and annotating it with data-stripe -attributes, you should use form's scope, i.e. attach values to form field's using ng-model. Values that are in the scope and that match to values that Stripe accepts, are sent. So if in addition to the formattable and validateable fields you want to send `address_state`, just add `<input type="text" ng-model="addressState" />` to your form.

**Important:** expiry makes a small exception. If you haven't explicitly defined `$scope.expMonth` and `$scope.expYear`, we take `$scope.expiry` and parse it into a month and year assuming mm / yy[yy] format that is produced by `payments-format="expiry"`.

When Stripe responds, it passes results to a callback function, which could be:

	$scope.handleStripe = function(status, response){
		if(response.error) {
			// there was an error. Fix it.
		} else {
			// got stripe token, now charge it or smt
			token = response.id
		}
	}

And then:

	<form stripe-form="handleStripe">
	...

Basically the directive sends the credit card details directly to stripe, which then returns a token that you can use to charge the card, subscribe a user or to do other things. This ensures that the card details themselves never hit your backend and thus you have to worry a little bit less.


## recurlyForm

This directive intercepts the form submission and calls out to `recurly.js` using the `v3` API. It works similarly to the `stripeForm` directive and makes the request to recurly to get the one-time use token:

		<form recurly-form="CALLBACK"> 
		...
		</form>

Instead of making the request to recurly, this directive will fetch the appropriate data from the form and make the request to recurly to get the token. Once this token has been retrieved from recurly, it will call the `CALLBACK` function passed in through the directive.

This directive uses credit card processing by default, BUT it also includes an option for using paypal. To use paypal instead of credit cards, simply add the `paypal` attribute to the `recurlyForm`:

		<form recurly-form="CALLBACK" paypal> 
		...
		</form>

## Example

See example-folder. You can run the example with

	grunt connect
	
then connect to it at http://localhost:8000/example/index.html
